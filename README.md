### project title: Data analysis
project overview
Data analysis is the process of examining, cleaning, and interpreting data to extract useful insights and support decision-making. It involves collecting data from various sources, cleaning it to ensure accuracy, and then using techniques like exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and trends. Advanced methods, such as statistical analysis and machine learning, can then be applied for deeper insights. Overall, data analysis is essential in various fields to help organizations make informed, data-driven decisions.

### data sources
The primary source of data used is from Kaggle, which is a great platform that offers a wide variety of datasets across different domains. Itâ€™s a valuable resource for data analysis projects, providing access to real-world data and allowing me to explore various data science techniques.
